# DAGS
Problem Summary
The task is to calculate the longest directed path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) starting from a given vertex. The implementation was done using Java, leveraging topological sorting to ensure a valid order of processing the vertices.

1. Did you fully read and understand the problem requirements?

Yes, the problem asks to calculate the longest directed path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) starting from a specific vertex. The graph is directed and acyclic, which allows the use of topological sorting.

2. Did you write and run tests?

Yes, tests were written and run to validate the solution against various test cases, including small and large graphs, as well as graphs with different structures (e.g., disconnected graphs and single vertices).

3. Did you check for edge cases?

Yes, the following edge cases were checked:

Disconnected graph components.
Graphs where the start vertex has no outgoing edges.
Graphs with only one vertex.

4. Did you fully consider performance? Efficiency? Scalability?

Yes, the solution uses topological sorting, which is optimal for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The algorithm runs in O(V + E) time complexity, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, which makes it suitable for large graphs.

5. Did you answer the questions at the bottom of the explanation? - Yes

Does the solution work for larger graphs? Yes, the solution is designed to work for large graphs with efficient time complexity. The topological sorting ensures that each vertex and edge is processed once.

Can you think of any optimizations? One possible optimization is to terminate the search early for paths that cannot contribute to the longest path, but this isn't necessary with the current approach as topological sorting ensures the graph is processed in linear time.

Whatâ€™s the computational complexity of your solution? The computational complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This includes both topological sorting and the dynamic programming step to calculate the longest path.

Are there any unusual cases that aren't handled? No, all edge cases such as disconnected graphs, vertices with no outgoing edges, and single-vertex graphs are handled correctly.

6. Are you prepared to discuss your work if you are asked to participate in the interview process?

Yes, I am prepared to discuss the implementation, performance considerations, and the choice of Java for the solution. I can explain how topological sorting and dynamic programming work together to find the longest path in a DAG.
